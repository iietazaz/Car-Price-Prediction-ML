# Car Price Prediction and Analysis
Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling project on car prices using a dataset of over 90,000 cars spanning several decades. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and the implementation of various machine learning algorithms to predict car prices based on their attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes the following features:

model: Car model (string)
price: Price of the car (numeric)
transmission: Type of transmission (string)
mileage: Car mileage (numeric)
fuelType: Type of fuel used (string)
tax: Road tax (numeric)
mpg: Miles per gallon (numeric)
engineSize: Size of the engine (numeric)
manufacturer: Car manufacturer (string)
Dataset (kaggle): 90,000+ Cars Data from 1970 to 2024
